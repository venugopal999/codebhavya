        solution:
            "The terms follow n² + 1: 1²+1=2, 2²+1=5, 3²+1=10 and 4²+1=17. The next term is 5²+1 = 26."

        answer: 2,
        difficulty: "medium",
        solution:

        ],
        answer: 1,
        difficulty: "medium",
        solution:

        question: "A sorted list contains one million values. Which observation most improves the search plan?",
        options: [
            "The values are sorted, so repeatedly halving the search area is possible",

            "The list size does not matter",
            "Sorting prevents all searches"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        difficulty: "hard",
        solution:
            "Because the values are sorted, the search space can be repeatedly halved. Recognizing this constraint leads to a much more efficient plan than checking every value."

        options: ["81", "100", "120", "121"],
        answer: 3,
        difficulty: "hard",
        solution:
            "Each term is three times the previous term plus 1: 1×3+1=4, 4×3+1=13 and 13×3+1=40. Therefore, 40×3+1=121."
